  <blockquote>
    <p>When Cyrus invaded Babylonia, Nabonidus was so busy trying to decipher the contents of the foundation stone of a thirty-two-century-old temple that he never noticed that he was no longer king until he returned to the city one evening and found Cyrus in residence at the new palace. At least that’s the story the black-haired people like to tell. Actually, Nabonidus was captured, imprisoned, freed. He then went back to his digging.</p>

<h2 class="typl8-gamma">About</h2>
<p class="typl8-drop-cap">
After enjoying programming for years, I discovered applied math in mid-undergrad. I decided it would be harder, and therefore more interesting, than “just” software engineering. After years of grad school—I am terminal ABD in electrical engineering from Ohio State University—and then working in the lovely D.C. metro area, I revised my views and came back to Ohio to work as a software engineer who happens to know about signal processing, machine learning, and web programming.</p>

<p>
The title for this web site comes from Professor Richard Hamming’s motto, “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers” (<a href="http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=893">SIAM</a>).</p>

<p>I have a wonderful family. Here we are in disguise.</p>
